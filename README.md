### !!! we need pro version for branch protection
### !!! so always work with your branch and merge it to the main branch

* clone the repo from matteo website
* create your branch with branch_name
* switch to that branch and set upstream


### Daily routine followed by each member
```
$ git pull                  // main branch
$ git switch user_name
$ git merge                 //from user branch

the user branch will sync with the main branch
work from your branch after that 

$ git add .                 //add the files
$ git commit -m "comment"
$ git push                  //if u have set the $ git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
$ git switch main 
$ git merge user_branch
$ git push
```
